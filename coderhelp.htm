            Coder Help</h3>
        <p>
            Coder is a program&nbsp;that allows healthcare providers to code their 
            patients&#39; healthcare visits and store data 
            into cloud storage. The idea is for all healthcare providers to share data that 
            is interesting for everyone and essential for public health planning without disclosing patient identifable 
            information or their specific practice identifiable data.</p>
    <p>
        Presently only claims sent to medical schemes are coded and the data is used for 
        checking claims. Coder offers a way to collect and share healthcare data on a 
        much larger scale, combining coding with geographical and other essential data 
        without compomising patient confidentialty.</p>

<h4>
        Visitsf all your patient Visits.&nbsp; You complile a new Visit 
        record for each patient encounter. Visit go into a Visits list. You synchonize 
        your Visits list with the server to upload the new Visits.</p>
<h4>
        Templates</h4>
<p align="left">
        Visits contain only general information so Coder gives you the facility to save 
        Visits as Templates for coding future Visits. Templates are just named Visits 
        without dates that you can list separately. You can select a Templates to 
        generate a new visit. Its a very quick and accurate way to generate data.</p>
<h4>
        Places</h4>
<p>
        Coder uses low resolution GPS coordinateCoder uses low resolution GPS coordinates to record where patients come from and 
        where they are treated.</p>
<p>
        We can provide the names and coordinates of major towns to import using File&gt;Import_places. 
        These go into the Places list for viewing and editing, You should add your practice region and the places of your referals. 
        Use decimal&nbsp; decimal degree coordinates. Coder rounds them to 
        0.1 degree accuracy.</p>
<h4>
        How it works</h4>
<p>
        Coder compiles and lists Visits files and provides the means to synchronise them 
        with a Internet server usisng a webservice. The server files all the Visits from 
        all practices together by appending them to &#39;day_region&#39; files.&nbsp; are uses 
        to store data (10 km map resolution)connects to webservice to store data on a 
        webserver.&nbsp; . When you synchonize your practice data, all 
        unsaved records are sent to the webservice, the appropriate day_region&nbsp; file opened 
        or created and the data appended to it, 
        one line per visit. The web service return&nbsp; the file length&nbsp; and Coder 
        uses this to compute the file position of each visit which allows you to edit 
        your data on the server..</p>
    <p>
        After allowing a month for late insertions and editing, the day files are sealed as 
        a&nbsp; &#39;read_only&#39; and together with other day files they form a 
        permanent data warehouse. Amazon S3 will probably be used for long term storage.be provided to search and retrieve information for any place 
        and date by processing from the 
        day files in the places of interest. Retrieved information could be in CSV of 
        XML format for viewing or processing.</p>
