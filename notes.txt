GLOBAL HEALTH GRID

This is my plan to store healthcare data in Azure cloud storage and to provide the tools and services to display and extract useful 
information. Previously data that has been collected by the heath profession for the medical schemes and public hospitals has not been  






However to be successful the program must be simple and fast and collect only essential data that will be used. 
I want this software and the information it produces to benefit and reward the healthcare providers so apart from providing data
for public epidemiology, the providers will keep a copy of their own data for their own practice statistics and use the 
global data to compare their practice profile. 

All healthcare will be able to store a 'discharge summary' for every patient they treat.
In most cases they will do this themselves but clinics might want to employ a coder to store all the patients' discharge data.
